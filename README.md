# Baseline Predictive Pipeline -- ETAI
20260490 António Favila Vieira

WEEK 2:
Conclusion:

The logistic regression  its training and test accuracies are almost identical. Probably no overfitting. Its  accuracy its 67.8% (ok), so the model is good but still could be better.

The second model seems to overfit. It has 82.9% training accuracy but only 63.1% test accuracy—a 19.8 difference. It is not dealing weel with unseen data.

WEEK 3:
Before data cleaning, the Logistic Regression model suffered from underfitting, demonstrating high stability but low predictive power with a well-aligned training accuracy of 67.9% and test accuracy of 67.8% (a minimal gap of 0.001). However, after cleaning, its training accuracy increased substantially to 83.1%, while its test performance degraded to 61.9%, causing the generalization gap to expand dramatically to 0.212. This shift indicates that while the cleaning process introduced feature transformations or encodings that allowed the linear model to better fit the training set, it ultimately induced severe overfitting to training-specific noise rather than improving its ability to evaluate unseen data

In contrast, the Decision Tree model exhibited persistent overfitting across both datasets, maintaining nearly identical training and testing metrics regardless of data cleaning. Prior to cleaning, the tree scored 82.9% on training data and 63.1% on test data (a 0.198 gap), which slightly deteriorated post-cleaning to an 83.1% train accuracy and a 62.1% test accuracy (a 0.210 gap). Because unconstrained decision trees naturally memorize patterns and noise, cleaning the raw features had a negligible effect on reducing variance, demonstrating that structural regularization—such as limiting tree depth—is necessary to improve generalization rather than relying solely on data preprocessing.


This is the **starting point** for your semester project: a small but *complete* predictive pipeline -- every piece a real project needs (entry point, config, data loading, preprocessing, model, evaluation), just kept as simple as possible for now.

The task: predict two-year recidivism using ProPublica's COMPAS
dataset -- the data behind a real 2016 investigation into a risk-
assessment algorithm actually used by US courts to help inform bail and sentencing decisions. See `data/README.md` for the full problem description and a complete data dictionary before you start.

It has some **deliberately weak spots**. Part of your work this
semester is finding them and making them better -- see the pipeline progress table below, which tracks what changes and why as the weeks
go on.

## Pipeline progress

This table is updated after each practical class, so you can always see what changed in the pipeline and why -- it's a running log, not a fixed syllabus.

| Week | Practical class focus | Added to the pipeline |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 2 | Introduction & baseline pipeline | Initial version: project structure, a single naive train/test split (no cross-validation), minimal preprocessing (drop rows with missing values, one-hot encode categoricals), logistic regression baseline, a first (deliberately simple) fairness check comparing our model's and COMPAS's own false-positive rate by race, train-vs-test accuracy reporting (to start spotting overfitting), and each run's full report saved automatically to `results/` |

## Environment setup

You only need to do this once per machine.

### macOS / Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv                 # creates an isolated Python environment in a folder called "venv"
source venv/bin/activate             # activates it -- packages install here, not system-wide, and stay out of your other projects
pip install -r requirements.txt      # installs the exact packages this project needs, into that environment
```

### Windows -- PowerShell
```powershell
python -m venv venv                  # creates an isolated Python environment in a folder called "venv"
venv\Scripts\activate                # activates it -- packages install here, not system-wide, and stay out of your other projects
pip install -r requirements.txt      # installs the exact packages this project needs, into that environment
```
If PowerShell blocks the activation script, run this once first:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

### Windows -- cmd.exe
Same three steps as above, just with cmd's own activation command:
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the environment is active you'll see `(venv)` at the start of your prompt. To leave it later, run `deactivate` (same command on every OS).

### Every time after the first

Creating the environment and installing packages only needs to happen once, ever. Every other time you sit down to work -- a new terminal window, the next practical class, tomorrow -- you don't repeat any of the steps above. From the project's root folder, you just need to:

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

**Windows**
```powershell
venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py
```

That's it -- activate, then run. If you don't see `(venv)` at the start of your prompt, the environment isn't active and `python main.py` may use the wrong Python (or fail to find a package) entirely.

## Running the pipeline

With the environment active (see above), from the project's root
folder, on any OS:
```bash
python main.py
```

This loads `config.yaml`, loads and preprocesses the data, trains the model, and prints:
- **train accuracy and test accuracy, side by side.** Comparing the two is how you catch overfitting: if the model looks much better on the data it was trained on than on data it's never seen, it has memorised rather than learned something that generalises. 
- a classification report on the test set
- a false-positive-rate-by-race comparison between our model and
  COMPAS's own score

All of this is also saved to a timestamped file in `results/` (e.g.`results/run_20260916_143012.txt`), so it doesn't just scroll past in your terminal -- open it later, or change something in `config.yaml` (like the model type) and compare the new file to the last one.
`results/` is created automatically the first time you run the
pipeline, and isn't tracked in git (see `.gitignore`) since it's
generated output, not source.

You're free to improve on this structure or restructure it entirely -- what matters is that your project stays runnable end-to-end with a single command, and that each piece (data, preprocessing, model, evaluation) stays easy to find and change independently.
